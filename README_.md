Alternative Fuel Locations (Updated: 2023)

# Project Description / Outline:

Exploring alternative fuel availability (AFA) in the Chicagoland area
can involve various factors, including the types of alternative fuels
available, the number and locations of fueling stations, and the
availability of vehicles that can use alternative fuels.

Some alternative fuels commonly used in the transportation sector
include electricity, hydrogen, compressed natural gas (CNG),
propane, and biodiesel. Each of these fuels has unique
characteristics and benefits, and the availability of these fuels can
vary depending on the region.

Regarding fueling stations, there are various options for alternative
fuels in the Chicagoland area. For example, there are over 150
electric vehicles (EV) charging stations throughout the city and
suburbs, including Level 2 charging stations and DC fast chargers.
Additionally, several CNG fueling stations are in the area, including
stations operated by Trillium and Clean Energy

# Alternative fuels are important for several reasons
● Environmental Benefits Alternative fuels emit lower levels of pollutants and greenhouse
gases than traditional fossil fuels. Using alternative fuels can help reduce air pollution,
positively impacting public health and the environment.

● Energy Security: Alternative fuels can help reduce dependence on foreign oil and
increase energy security. By diversifying our energy sources, we can reduce reliance
on a single energy source and decrease our vulnerability to supply disruptions.

● Economic Benefits: Alternative fuels can create new jobs and industries, particularly in
the renewable energy sector. Investing in alternative fuels can create new opportunities
for businesses and workers and spur economic growth.

● Innovation: Developing and implementing alternative fuels requires technological
innovation and research. Investing in alternative fuels can lead to discoveries and
advances in clean energy technology, benefiting various industries and sectors.

● Long-Term Sustainability: Fossil fuels are finite resources, and their continued use can
have negative long-term consequences for the environment and future generations.
Alternative fuels offer a more sustainable energy source that can be used without
depleting natural resources.

# Research Questions to answer:

1. What is the alternative Fuel Availability by ZIP Code or State?
2. What is the stations abundance accross cities in NE Illinois?
3. How many alternative fuel types does Chicago offer?
4. Explore the geographical locations of AFA for ELC and other fuel types
5. Has AFA increased over the recent years?
6. Who owns the stations? How could owners be incentived to offer more services?

## Conclusions - Present and Future States of Alternative Fuel

● The adoption of alternative fuels in Chicagoland can potentially lead to significant benefits such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. However, the challenges of infrastructure development and cost-effectiveness may hinder the widespread adoption of alternative fuels in the region.

● It is important to note that the success of alternative fuels will also depend on consumer awareness and willingness to adopt new technologies. Therefore, efforts to educate and encourage consumers to switch to alternative fuels may play a critical role in achieving a sustainable and clean energy future for Chicagoland.

● The impact of COVID-19 on the electric transportation industry has been complex and multifaceted. Here are some key points:
  > Supply chain disruptions: The pandemic caused major disruptions to global supply chains, which affected the production and availability of components and materials needed for electric vehicles (EVs) and their charging infrastructure.

  > Sales and demand: Sales of EVs initially declined due to the pandemic as people postponed major purchases and focused on essential goods. However, many analysts believe that the pandemic has accelerated the transition to electric vehicles due to a greater focus on environmental sustainability, lower operating costs, and government incentives.

  > Government support: Many governments around the world have provided financial support and incentives for the electric transportation industry in response to the pandemic, including funding for EV charging infrastructure, tax credits for EV purchases, and subsidies for EV manufacturers.

● Overall, the growth of electric vehicles has been relatively slow and steady since 1999, but it has accelerated significantly in recent years, and many experts predict that the EV market will continue to grow rapidly in the coming years as technology improves, costs decline, and consumers and governments increasingly prioritize sustainability and clean energy.
● Further research and data analysis are needed to draw more definitive conclusions about the potential benefits and challenges of alternative fuels in Chicagoland.
